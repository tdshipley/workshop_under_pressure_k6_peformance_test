# How to debug k6 load testing scripts

While the k6 metrics help you [understand what happened in a k6 test](../exercise-2/02-Understanding-k6-results.md), you may need more detailed information when you're in the process of writing your load-testing script. In this section, you'll learn what you can do to figure out why your script is failing.

*In this k6 Office Hours, Tom Miseur and Nicole van der Hoeven demonstrate different ways to debug a k6 load testing script.*

There are a few things you can add to your script that can help you determine what's happening at which point in the script.

### Using checks

Consider the script below.

```js
import http from 'k6/http';

let usernameArr = ['admin', 'test_user', 'guest'];
let passwordArr = ['123', '1234', '12345'];

export default function() {
    // Get random username and password from array
    let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    let username = usernameArr[rand];
    let password = passwordArr[rand];

    http.post('http://test.k6.io/login.php', { login: username, password: password });
}
```

This script declares two simple arrays: one containing usernames, and one containing passwords.
The script chooses one pair from those arrays randomly, then passes them onto an HTTP POST request.

The script is saved in `./src/buggy-test.js` you can run it like this:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js
```

Did you notice any errors? No, neither did we! Let's look at the output:

```shell

          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/   
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /

Nothing indicates an error, yet there is one.

To find it, we could use a check.

Checks are a type of testing criteria that can be used to verify the response returned by a request. We
will talk more about checks in exercise 4. But for now let's add a check that the response returns a 200
status code. Update `./src/buggy-test.js` to match the code below:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

let usernameArr = ['admin', 'test_user', 'guest'];
let passwordArr = ['123', '1234', '12345'];

export default function() {
    // Get random username and password from array
    let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    let username = usernameArr[rand];
    let password = passwordArr[rand];

    let response = http.post('http://test.k6.io/login.php', { login: username, password: password });

    // Check the status returned is a 200
    check(response, {
        'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    })
}
```

The above script now checks whether the response returned is an HTTP 200.

Run that script again with the check in place:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js
```

You can see a significant change in the end-of-test summary:

```shell
     ✗ is status 200
      ↳  0% — ✓ 0 / ✗ 1
```

It turns out that the script does not return an HTTP 200 as expected, but that was difficult to find without the check. Adding the check identifies that there is a problem.

But what's going on? 

### Add logging

Since the script uses test data, it could very well be that the username and password are incorrect. Maybe the combination is what causes an authentication error. In this case, the `username` and `password` arrays have only three elements, so it wouldn't be too difficult to test them all manually. But what if you had hundreds of them?

In that case, you can try adding logging at specific parts of your script by using `console.log()`. Update
`./src/buggy-test.js` so it matches the code below:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

let usernameArr = ['admin', 'test_user', 'guest'];
let passwordArr = ['123', '1234', '12345'];

export default function() {
    // Get random username and password from array
    let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 3);
    let username = usernameArr[rand];
    let password = passwordArr[rand];
    console.log('username: ' + username, ' / password: ' + password);

    let response = http.post('http://test.k6.io/login.php', { login: username, password: password });
    check(response, {
        'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    })
}
```

Run that script again with the `console.log()` in place:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js
```

A statement prints out the exact combination used, like this:

```shell
INFO[0000] username: guest  / password: 12345          source=console
```

That way, you know exactly which combination to try. Perhaps the username or the password is incorrect, or perhaps both. Either way, adding logs to your script help you understand the value of key variables your script uses.

> :warning: **Disable logging during load tests**. `console.log()` can be very resource-intensive, and too much logging can affect your test results. Comment out logging as much as possible to avoid high resource utilization as the test runs.

Now, imagine you try to log into the app using the username and password selected by the script (`guest` and `12345`) and it doesn't work. Aha! The credentials were wrong to begin with. You verify that the other two accounts you had work.

Remove the third `guest` credentials and modify the random number to return only `0` or `1`. Do that by
updating `./src/buggy-test.js` to match the code below:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

let usernameArr = ['admin', 'test_user'];
let passwordArr = ['123', '1234'];

export default function() {

    // Get random username and password from array
    let rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
    let username = usernameArr[rand];
    let password = passwordArr[rand];
	console.log('username: ' + username, ' / password: ' + password);

    let response = http.post('http://test.k6.io/login.php', { login: username, password: password });
    check(response, {
        'is status 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    })
}
```

Run `./src/buggy-test.js` again to see if the test is fixed:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js
```

Despite the corrected credentials, it still fails. This is a good thing! It means you've solved the first error and can begin working on the second.

What else could be wrong? What response is being returned, if not an HTTP 200?

### Use the HTTP debug flag

To find out exactly what the request is returning, you can use the `--http-debug` flag. Run the test like this:

```shell
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js --http-debug
```

This time, the output includes some new information:

```shell
          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/   
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /    
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\  
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  | 
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: buggy-test.js
     output: -

  scenarios: (100.00%) 1 scenario, 1 max VUs, 10m30s max duration (incl. graceful stop):
           * default: 1 iterations for each of 1 VUs (maxDuration: 10m0s, gracefulStop: 30s)

> :warning: **Use HTTP-debug only while debugging** `http-debug` can be quite noisy, so avoid using it for longer or larger tests. It is best used for troubleshooting while writing a script.

The end-of-test summary now includes information on 2 requests and 2 responses. But wait a minute. Doesn't the script have only one request?

Analyzing the output further, you can see what happened:
- k6 sent an initial POST request.
- The server responded with an HTTP 308 redirect.
- k6 sent another POST, prompted by the redirect.
- The server responded with an HTTP 403 Forbidden.

Even though the script only contains a single request, the server's response prompted k6 to make a redirected request, which ultimately failed. [HTTP 403 Forbidden](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/403) is an error relating to an authentication issue. This error confirms the theory of an authentication error.

But *why* is there an authentication error?

To get even more information, run the script again, this time requesting a full HTTP debug:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/buggy-test.js --http-debug=full
```

This time, you see not just the response and request headers but also the request and response *bodies*:

34
error: invalid csrf token
token: <not set>
session: 
0
```

The response body for the HTTP 403 reveals the issue: `error: invalid csrf token`.

The script posts a username and password, but no CSRF token! Bingo.

CSRF ([Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/csrf)) tokens are used to improve security by preventing attackers from hijacking a user's session. It appears the application requires a CSRF token that the script doesn't yet have. To get the CSRF token, you can create an initial request to get `https://test.k6.io/` and parse the response for that token. We'll cover that in the next section.

## Test your knowledge

### Question 1

What's the best way to verify whether an application returns a PDF file in response to a request sent by your script?

A: Add a check based on the response body size.

B: Use the `http-debug` flag to try to read the content of the PDF.

C: Add a `console.log()` statement after the request is made.

### Question 2

In the script used on this page, a random number is used to select a user account from arrays. How could you find out what the value of the random number is each time you run the script?

A: 

```js
check(response, {
        'random number selected': (r) => r.rand === 0,
    })
```

B: `k6 run test.js --http-debug="rand"`

C: `console.log('rand', rand);`

### Question 3

Why should you disable as much logging as possible during a ramped-up load test?

A: You should never do any logging when you're running a proper test.

B: Unnecessary logging eats up resources on the load generator.

C: Using `http-debug` is a better choice for use during a load test.

### Answers

1. A. The `http-debug` and `console.log` approaches may be unnecessarily verbose and taxing on load generator resourecs. If you know that a PDF file is significantly larger than the size of a response returned without a PDF, you can use response body size to verify the PDF.
2. C. `console.log()` is great for use cases like this, especially while troubleshooting or debugging a script.
3. B. Writing too much information to logs may itself be a performance bottleneck within the load generator, so be juidicious about the information you print and save.
