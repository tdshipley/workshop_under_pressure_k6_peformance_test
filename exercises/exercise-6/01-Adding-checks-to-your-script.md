Checks are a type of testing criteria that can be used to verify the response returned by a request.

Up until now, you've been using `console.log()` to print the response body to the terminal. This approach is useful for debugging, but it can quickly get out of hand if the response body is large or if you decide to run the test with more than one VU. Instead, in this section, you'll learn how to use checks.

## How to add checks to your script

Look in the `./src` folder for this exercise and see a file called `checks.js.`. Let's look at the source in your command line run:

```
cat ./src/checks.js
```

### Checkpoint:
 Ten lines of code should be in your terminal. 

</br>
<details>
    <summary>**Problem** Don't see ten lines of code? Click me for help.</summary>

You should see an output in your terminal similar to this:

```
thomas.shipley@HOME exercise-6 % cat ./src/checks.js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function() {
  let url = 'https://httpbin.test.k6.io/post';
  let response = http.post(url, 'Hello world!');
  check(response, {
      'Application says hello': (r) => r.body.includes('Hello world!')
  });
} 
```

If you see an output like this:

```
cat: .checks.js: No such file or directory
```

Check your terminal is in the exercise-6 folder
</details>
</br>

You already know the expected response of the target server to the request the script is sending: it should send back whatever the script sends to it. In this case, that's `Hello world!`

So, remove the `console.log()` statement and add a check by copying this code snippet into `./src/checks.js`:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function() {
  let url = 'https://httpbin.test.k6.io/post';
  let response = http.post(url, 'Hello world!');
  check(response, {
      'Application says hello': (r) => r.body.includes('Hello world!')
  });
}
```

Note that you need to import the `check` from the k6 library:

```js
import { check } from 'k6';
```

And you need to put the actual check in the default function:

```js
check(response, {
      'Application says hello': (r) => r.body.includes('Hello world!')
  });
}
```

The check you've just added looks for the string `Hello world!` in the body of the response of *every* request.

### Running the script

What does it look like in the end-of-test summary? Save your script and run:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/checks.js
```

and you should see output similar to this:

```plain
          /\      |‾‾| /‾‾/   /‾‾/   
     /\  /  \     |  |/  /   /  /    
    /  \/    \    |     (   /   ‾‾\  
   /          \   |  |\  \ |  (‾)  | 
  / __________ \  |__| \__\ \_____/ .io

  execution: local
     script: checks.js
     output: -

     iterations.....................: 1       1.419825/s
```

The new check is displayed in the lines:

```plain
	✓ Application says hello

     checks.........................: 100.00% ✓ 1        ✗ 0
```

and the `✓` means that all the requests executed (just one in this test run) passed the check. This test run had a 100% pass rate for checks.

### Failed checks

What does it look like when the check fails?

Modify `./src/checks.js` to search for text that shouldn't be found in the response, like so:

```js
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check } from 'k6';

export default function() {
  let url = 'https://httpbin.test.k6.io/post';
  let response = http.post(url, 'Hello world!');
  check(response, {
      'Application says hello': (r) => r.body.includes('Bonjour!')
  });
}
```

Run that:

```
docker run --rm -i grafana/k6 run - <./src/checks.js
```

You should get the following result:

```plain
     ✗ Application says hello
      ↳  0% — ✓ 0 / ✗ 1

     checks.........................: 0.00%  ✓ 0        ✗ 1
```

This time, the `✗ 1` indicates that one check failed.

### Failed checks are not errors

You may have noticed that in the last example, `http_req_failed`, or the HTTP error rate, was not affected by the failing check. This is because checks do not stop a script from executing successfully, and they do not return a failed exit status.

> :bulb: To make failing checks stop your test, you can [combine them with thresholds](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds/#failing-a-load-test-using-checks).

## Other types of checks

The [checks](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/checks/) page contains other types of checks you can do, including the HTTP response code and the response body size. You can also include multiple checks for a single response.

## Test your knowledge

### Question 1

Which of the following can you use a check to verify?

A: Whether the 95th percentage response time of the request was greater than 1s

B: The size of the response body returned

C: The error rate of the test


### Question 2

What part of the test do checks assess?

A: The response time of a request

B: The syntax of the request sent to the application

C: The application server's response


### Question 3

In the following snippet from the end-of-test summary, how many checks failed?

```plain
     ✗ Application says hello
      ↳  51% — ✓ 1215 / ✗ 1144

     checks.........................: 51.50% ✓ 1215      ✗ 1144
```

A: 51.50%

B: 1215

C: 1144

### Answer

1. B. The 95th percentile of the response time is an aggregated metric: it relies on measurements from all requests up to that point. This is not something you can create a check for, although you can certainly include this as a [threshold](https://k6.io/docs/using-k6/thresholds/) in your script. The error rate of a test is similarly aggregated. B, the size of the response body, is the correct answer.
2. C. Checks parse the responses from the application server, not the request sent by k6.
3. C. The number of checks that failed is displayed in  `✗ 1144`. This request's checks passed 51.50% of the time.
