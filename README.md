# Workshop: Under Pressure! Performance Testing APIs with K6
Workshop: Under Pressure! Performance Testing APIs with K6 - Delivered as part of Nordic Testing Days 2023

# Exercises

During this workshop you will have three coding exercises to complete:

* [Exercise 2 - Basics of k6](./exercises/exercise-2/) This exercise
will get you started with k6 and the basics of writing, running
and understanding the output of a test.
* [Exercise 4 - More k6](./exercises/exercise-4/) in this exercise we
will dive into more detail of k6. Such as debugging tests, adding test data, making parallel requests and other more advanced features.
* [Exercise 6 - Checks and Thresholds](./exercises/exercise-6/) In the final
exercise, you will learn how to add checks and thresholds to your test.
These will be handy when thinking about golden signals and how you
might design an API performance test to check against them.

# k6Learn

This workshop is based on the [k6Learn workshop](https://github.com/grafana/k6-learn). However, it only includes some of the lessons, so if you want to explore k6 more, it is a great place to start. Thanks to the k6 team for providing such a great resource.
